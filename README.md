# Rejoining fragmented ancient bamboo slips with physics-driven deep learning

Bamboo slips, serving as a fundamental medium for documenting ancient East Asian civilizations,contain invaluable historical records spanning philosophy, law, and social life-period. Their durability has enabled these artifacts to survive millennia underground while retaining legible content, offering scholars unprecedented insights into historical societies. However, the excavation of these delicate artifacts presents a critical challenge - many bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of pieces, significantly complicating efforts to reconstruct and interpret their content. This fragmentation creates a fundamental obstacle in accessing the wealth of historical knowledge contained in these artifacts.We present WisePanda, the first physics-driven deep learning framework designed for rejoining fragmented ancient bamboo slips.WisePanda is designed to assist and expand the archaeologist’s workflow: its architecture features an interpretable pipeline for fragmented bamboo slip rejoining, leveraging synthesized data based on fracture physics for model training and providing top-k predictions to support expert decision-making.

Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-20 matching accuracy from 35% to 69%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips,demonstrating the powerful impact of this collaborative research tool.Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process.This work demonstrates how models like WisePanda can enhance collaboration between AI and historians, fundamentally transforming how we study and interpret the rich and complex history of China.

While manual fragment rejoining is prohibitively time-consuming - the very problem we aim to solve - this same process would traditionally be required to generate training data for the model. We resolve this dilemma by resorting to the physics of fracture.By modeling the physical properties of bamboo and the processes that govern its degradation, we generate extensive synthetic training data that captures the essential characteristics of real paired fragment slips. This physics-driven approach enables us to produce large-scale, realistic training data without requiring manual matching efforts, while ensuring the model learns meaningful patterns based on actual material properties rather than superficial features.
